                             INSTALLATION

0) As of version 0.10.0 autohell stuff was thrown out because I
   dislike it. In my view, LMDBG now looks much better and cleaner but
   the installation phase becomes a bit more complex because
   additional software is needed.

   a) NetBSD make also known as bmake is required for building and
   installing LMDBG.  It is already packaged for some Linux distros
   (e.g. Fedora).  Some others distros (Debian) provide an ancient
   NetBSD make under name pmake which may work too but I'd recomment
   to use latest bmake. Only latest stable bmake is tested. If you are
   happy pkgsrc user ;-) (http://www.pkgsrc.org) of course bmake is
   already installed because it is a part pkgsrc
   bootstrap. DragonFlyBSD also have bmake in its base system.  NOTE:
   FreeBSD and OpenBSD make-s are not good. Unfortunately they are
   incompatible with NetBSD bmake.

   b) BSD Mk files (bsd.*.mk) is also an essential software for
   building and installing LMDBG. Install pkgsrc's mk-file from here
   http://mova.org/~cheusov/pub/netbsd-tools/pkgsrc-mk-files/.
   Again, if you are a pkgsrc user mk-files are already installed.

   c) mk-configure is also needed. This is extension for bsd.*.mk files
   and is a lightweight and very simple replacement for GNU autoconf
   and GNU automake.
   Download it from
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/mk-configure/

1) After successfully installing bmake, Mk files and mk-configure you
   are ready for installing LMDBG.

   Uncompress LMDBG tarball you've downloaded like this
   gzip -dc lmdbg-X-Y-Z.tar.gz | tar -xf-

   If you read this text, this step is probably already done :-)

2) cd lmdbg-X-Y-Z

3) bmake

   If you are unfamiliar with bmake see below for the samples of
   building and installation.

4) (optional) bmake test
   If this command fails on your system, PLEASE LET ME NOW.

5) bmake install-dirs install

If you need to change the default building options,
run bmake like this

     env [INITIAL_ASSIGNMENTS] bmake <target> [YOUR_ASSIGNMENTS]

There are a lot of Makefile variables that can be changed during
building and installation.  See the Makefile for LMDBG's own variables
(All they are in the begining of Makefile).

Examples of building and installing:

 1)  bmake all install-dirs install

 2)  env CC=gcc \
       PREFIX=/home/cheusov/local \
       CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/pkg/include' \
       LDFLAGS='-L/usr/pkg/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/pkg/lib' \
       LDADD=-lextralib \
       CFLAGS='-Werror -Wall' \
       BINOWN=cheusov \
       BINGRP=users \
       MANOWN=cheusov \
       MANGRP=users \
       MKCATPAGES=no \
          bmake -s all install-dirs install
