                             INSTALLATION

0) As of version 0.10.0 autohell stuff was thrown out because I
   dislike it. In my view, LMDBG now looks much better and cleaner but
   the installation phase becomes a bit more complex because
   additional software is needed for building it.

   a) NetBSD make also known as bmake is required for building and
   installing LMDBG.  It is already packaged for some Linux distros
   (e.g. Fedora and Gentoo).  Some others distros (Debian) provide an
   ancient NetBSD make under name 'pmake' which may work too but I'd
   recomment to use latest bmake. Only latest stable bmake is
   tested. If you are happy pkgsrc user ;-) (http://www.pkgsrc.org) of
   course bmake is already installed because it is a part pkgsrc
   bootstrap. DragonFlyBSD also have bmake in its base system.  NOTE:
   FreeBSD and OpenBSD make-s are not good. Unfortunately they are
   incompatible with NetBSD bmake.

   b) mk-configure is also needed. This is a lightweight and very
   simple replacement for GNU autotools.

1) LMDBG also needs a pipestatus, a set of shell functions for checking an
   exit status of ALL programs in a pipe.

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/pipestatus/

2) After successfully installing bmake, mk-configure and pipestatus you
   are ready to install LMDBG.

   Uncompress LMDBG tarball you've downloaded like this
   gzip -dc lmdbg-X-Y-Z.tar.gz | tar -xf-

   If you read this text, this step is probably already done :-)

3) cd lmdbg-X-Y-Z

4) mkcmake

   mkcmake is just a simple wrapper over bmake. It is a part of mk-configure.
   If you are unfamiliar with bmake see below for the samples of
   building and installation.

5) (optional) mkcmake test
   If this command fails on your system, PLEASE LET ME NOW.

6) mkcmake installdirs install

If you need to change the default build options,
run mkcmake like this

     env [DEFAULT_ASSIGNMENTS] mkcmake <target> [YOUR_ASSIGNMENTS]

There are a lot of Makefile variables that can be changed during
build and installation.  See Makefiles for LMDBG's own variables
(All they are in the begining of Makefile).

Examples of building and installing:

 1)  mkcmake all installdirs install

 2)  env CC=gcc \
       PREFIX=/home/cheusov/local \
       CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/pkg/include' \
       LDFLAGS='-L/usr/pkg/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/pkg/lib' \
       LDADD=-lextralib \
       CFLAGS='-Werror -Wall' \
       BINOWN=cheusov \
       BINGRP=users \
       MANOWN=cheusov \
       MANGRP=users \
       GDB=/usr/pkg/bin/gdb \
       MKCATPAGES=no \
          mkcmake -s all installdirs install
