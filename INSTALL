                             INSTALLATION

0) As of version 0.10.0 autohell stuff was thrown out because I hate
   it. It's extreamly ugly. In my view, now everything looks much
   better and cleaner but the installation phase becomes a bit more
   complex because additional software is needed.

   a) NetBSD make also known as bmake is required for building and
   installing LMDBG.  It is already packaged for some Linux distros
   (e.g. Fedora).  Some others (Debian) provide an ancient NetBSD make
   under name pmake which is also good. If you are happy pkgsrc user
   ;-) (http://www.pkgsrc.org) of course bmake is already installed
   because it is a part pkgsrc bootstrap. DragonFlyBSD also have bmake
   in its base system.
   NOTE: FreeBSD and OpenBSD make-s are not good. Unfortunately
   they are incompatible with NetBSD bmake.

   b) BSD Mk files (bsd.*.mk) is also an essential software for
   building and installing LMDBG. They are a part of Debian's pmake.
   You can download bsd.*.mk files there
   http://roga-i-kopita.example.com/path/to

   c) mk-configure is also needed. This is extension for bsd.*.mk files
   and is a lightweight and very simple replacement for GNU autoconf.

1) After successfully installing bmake, Mk files and mk-configure you
   are ready for installing LMDBG.

   Uncompress LMDBG tarball you've downloaded like this
   gzip -dc lmdbg-X-Y-Z.tar.gz | tar -xf-

   If you ready this text, this step is probably already done :-)

2) cd paexec-X-Y-Z

3) bmake

   If you are unfamiliar with bmake see below for the samples of
   building and installation.

4) (optional) bmake test
   If this command fails on your system, PLEASE LET ME NOW.

5) bmake install-dirs install

If you need to change the default building options,
run bmake like this

     env [YOUR_ASSIGNMENTS] bmake <target>

There are a lot of Makefile variables that can be changed during
building and installation.  See the Makefile for LMDBG's own variables
(All they are in the begining of Makefile).

BSD make's variables (most commonly used,
for all others - see bmake's documentation and .mk files)

 BINDIR - where LMDBG executables itself are installed to
 MANDIR - where manual pages are installed to

 BINOWN - owner for LMDBG executables
 BINGRP - group for LMDBG executables

 MANOWN - man pages owner
 MANGRP - man pages group

Examples of building and installing:

 1)  bmake all install-dirs install

 2)  env CC=gcc \
       PREFIX=/home/cheusov/local \
       CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/pkg/include' \
       LDFLAGS='-L/usr/pkg/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/pkg/lib' \
       LDADD=-lextralib \
       CFLAGS='-Werror -Wall' \
       BINOWN=cheusov \
       BINGRP=users \
       MANOWN=cheusov \
       MANGRP=users \
       MKCATPAGES=no \
          bmake -s all install-dirs install
