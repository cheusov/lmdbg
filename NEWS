Version 0.8.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 28 Feb 2009 15:58:33 +0200

  GPL phantoms were completely removed.

  Minor fixes in Makefile

  Minor clean-ups in stacktrace.c

======================================================================
Version 0.8.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 22 Feb 2009 23:07:59 +0200

  Completely new implementation of stacktrace function.  Now it is my
  own, portable to almost any hardware where gcc works. There is no
  limit on i386 anymore. YAMD code was thrown out.  GPL was thrown out
  too. I prefer MIT license.

  Documentation is now in READ file. Read it! ;-)

  Lots of regression tests was written. This release of LMDBG were
  sucessfully tested under the following platforms:
    NetBSD/x86/gcc
    NetBSD/alpha/gcc
    FreeBSD/x86/gcc
    Linux/x86/gcc
    Solaris/x86/gcc

  lmdbg-sym:
      added: -g option, synonym for --with-gdb.
      -g becomes the default.
      added: -a option for using addr2line(1) instead of gdb(1).
      fix for Solaris (printf ("%p") doesn't output leading 0x).

  lmdbg-run:
      added: -p option, synonyms for --pipe.
      malloc uses --> as a separator, not ->.

  lmdbg-check ins splitted in two executables:
     lmdbg-leaks    - for normal memory leaks,
     lmdbg-sysleaks - for memory leaks in system/external libraries.
     See README file.

Version 0.4.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 21 Feb 2009 13:41:37 +0200

  fix: lmdbg can also be build by BSD make.
       GNUmake-isms were removed from Makefile.in.

======================================================================
Version 0.4.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Thu, 28 Aug 2008 11:53:42 +0300

  FIXED: segfault under Linux (glibc-2.3.6). It happens because
      (not checked) dlsym/dlopen use malloc/free etc.

      Now, under Linux glibc's __malloc_hook, __realloc_hook
      etc. are used

  config.guess and config.sub updated
