Version 0.12.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri, 20 Nov 2009 00:17:28 +0200

  ADDED: support for calloc(3) and posix_memalign(3).

  Latest mk-configure is required for building.

  A target for testing lmdbg is again "test"! :-)

  Partial support for OpenBSD. Partial because I don't know how to
  detect where shared lib's code begins, there are no /proc/$$/maps.

  added: -a and -g options for "lmdbg" script.

  cleanups:
    - SHLIB_MAJOR/MINOR are used instead of dirty hacks.

  More regression tests.

======================================================================
Version 0.11.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 25 Jul 2009 01:48:15 +0300

  Support for modern Linux/glibc where libraries are loaded
  to different regions of the virtual memory
  (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization).
  To handle this lmdbg-run adds the special "info section" information
  obtained from /proc/<pid>/maps available on NetBSD and Linux
  to the log file, and lmdbg-sym uses this information.

  fixed: enabling malloc logging in lmdbg-sym was an extreamly strange
  idea.  This was just an oversight. Now it is disabled.

  ***** A TARGET FOR TESTING LMDBG IS NOW "check", NOT "test"! *****

  Additional regression test for lmdbg-sym and shared libraries.

  WARNS=4 for libstacktrace library

  WARNS=4 for liblmdbg library

  Two internal helper scripts:
  scripts/lmdbg-multi2single and scripts/lmdbg-single2multi.

  Other minor improvements, clean-ups and fixes.

======================================================================
Version 0.10.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 31 May 2009 15:17:20 +0300

  Completely NEW build system based on NetBSD make (aka bmake),
  mk-configure and pkgsrc's mk-files.  It makes building LMDBG a bit
  harder (user have to install new building tools, most probably from
  sources :-( ) but makes the code *much* simplier and makes
  development and supporting *drammatically* easier. See INSTALL file
  for the installation instructions.

  This release of LMDBG was sucessfully tested under the following
  platforms: NetBSD-5.0/x86/gcc, NetBSD-4.0/x86/gcc,
  Linux/glibc-2.3/x86/gcc, FreeBSD-6.2/x86/gcc and Solaris-10/x86/gcc.
  NetBSD-2/alpha/gcc also partially works (unfortunately gcc's
  __builtin_return_address and __builtin_frame_address return NULL
  with non-zero arguments on NetBSD-2/alpha :-(, that is stacktrace
  consists on single stack frame).

  - Now all utilities have man pages.

  - separation of libstacktrace library which is compatible (has a
    similar API) with GNU libc's backtrace(3) but works just perfectly
    under NetBSD, FreeBSD and Solaris.

  - lmdbg-leak-check has been renamed to lmdbg.

  - lmdbg-sysleaks:
    - Two new keywords in config file: ignore_basefile, ignore_baseline.
    - Support for shitty Solaris' /bin/sh.

  - lmdbg-sym:
    Fixes for -a mode. Now it outputs results in the same format as -g.

  - lmdbg-run and lmdbg-sym:
    LMDBG_ENV environment variable...

  - LMDBG_LIBDYN variables has been renamed to LMDBG_LIB.

  - tests/test.sh:
  Diverse fixes for Solaris
    - support for shitty shell :-/
    - 0x vs sprintf('%p", ...)

  - lmdbg.c:
    fixed: log_enabled variable is set from gdb, so it must not be static.
    fixed: lint(1) warnings.

  - Both libstacktrace and liblmdbg libraries are built with '-O0 -g'
    flags.

======================================================================
Version 0.10alpha1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 29 Mar 2009 17:13:04 +0300

  Good bye GNU autotools aka autohell! Now lmdbg is built using
  http://sf.net/projects/mk-configure and NetBSD bmake.

  I'll describe other changes in 0.10.0 release.

  This release is intermediate.

======================================================================
Version 0.9.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  8 Mar 2009 12:59:45 +0200

  stacktrace.c + stacktrace.h = libstacktrace with API
  compatible with GLIBC's backtrace(3).
  See install.stacktrace Makefile's target.

  Code clean-ups

======================================================================
Version 0.8.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 28 Feb 2009 15:58:33 +0200

  GPL phantoms were completely removed.

  Minor fixes in Makefile

  Minor clean-ups in stacktrace.c

======================================================================
Version 0.8.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 22 Feb 2009 23:07:59 +0200

  Completely new implementation of stacktrace function.  Now it is my
  own, portable to almost any hardware where gcc works. There is no
  limit on i386 anymore. YAMD code was thrown out.  GPL was thrown out
  too. I prefer MIT license.

  Documentation is now in READ file. Read it! ;-)

  Lots of regression tests was written. This release of LMDBG were
  sucessfully tested under the following platforms:
    NetBSD/x86/gcc
    NetBSD/alpha/gcc
    FreeBSD/x86/gcc
    Linux/x86/gcc
    Solaris/x86/gcc

  lmdbg-sym:
      added: -g option, synonym for --with-gdb.
      -g becomes the default.
      added: -a option for using addr2line(1) instead of gdb(1).
      fix for Solaris (printf ("%p") doesn't output leading 0x).

  lmdbg-run:
      added: -p option, synonyms for --pipe.
      malloc uses --> as a separator, not ->.

  lmdbg-check ins splitted in two executables:
     lmdbg-leaks    - for normal memory leaks,
     lmdbg-sysleaks - for memory leaks in system/external libraries.
     See README file.

======================================================================
Version 0.4.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 21 Feb 2009 13:41:37 +0200

  fix: lmdbg can also be build by BSD make.
       GNUmake-isms were removed from Makefile.in.

======================================================================
Version 0.4.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Thu, 28 Aug 2008 11:53:42 +0300

  FIXED: segfault under Linux (glibc-2.3.6). It happens because
      (not checked) dlsym/dlopen use malloc/free etc.

      Now, under Linux glibc's __malloc_hook, __realloc_hook
      etc. are used

  config.guess and config.sub updated

======================================================================
Version 0.0.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Apr 2008

   first publicly available release
